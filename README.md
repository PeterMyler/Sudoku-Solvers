# Sudoku solvers
Solver.py implements the basic backtracking approach to solve sudoku boards.\
Better-Solver.py implements a lot more efficient ways to solve sudoku boards.

## Requirements
Better-Solver.py requires numpy
```
pip install numpy
```

I also made a youtube video on the basic solver: https://youtu.be/bdX0AfEvN0Q
